COVID-19 Analysis Project

A data science project to analyze and visualize COVID-19 data in California from March 2020 to May 2023

Project Goals

Visualize the trends and patterns of COVID-19 cases in California over time.
Calculate and visualize the rolling mean and standard deviation of COVID-19 cases to smooth out the noise and identify changes in variability.
Provide insights and recommendations for policy makers based on the analysis.
The Plan

Acquire the data from public sources
Use web scraping techniques to collect daily COVID-19 case data from the California Department of Public Health website.

Split data into train and test sets
Explore data in search of trends and patterns
Visualize daily COVID-19 cases in California using line plots.
Use rolling mean and standard deviation to identify trends and changes in variability.
Provide insights and recommendations
Analyze the trends and patterns of COVID-19 cases to provide insights for policy makers.
Provide recommendations based on the analysis to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19.
Conclusion

Summary
Daily COVID-19 cases in California showed significant fluctuations, with multiple peaks and troughs over time.
The rolling mean and standard deviation of COVID-19 cases helped to smooth out the noise and identify changes in variability.
Recommendations
Implement policies that target areas where COVID-19 cases are consistently high.
Promote and encourage vaccination to help reduce the spread of COVID-19.
Next Steps
Collect additional data from other states and countries to compare the trends and patterns of COVID-19 cases.
